# PyGEngineUTI
Started developing...
The idea is to create a role play game. 
The secondary product of this project should be a RPG engine.

Now structure is:
_GUI-Logic File
|_class module
|_map module
|_story module (WIP)
  |_quest module (WIP)
  
I wish I'll not forget about its development.

If there is a release, contents of DEPRECATED directory are removed.
